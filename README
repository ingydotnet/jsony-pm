NAME
    JSONY - Relaxed JSON with a little bit of YAML

SYNOPSIS
        use JSONY;

        my $data = JSONY->new->load($jsony_string);

DESCRIPTION
    JSONY is a data language that is simlar to JSON, just more chill. All
    valid JSON is also valid JSONY (and represents the same thing when
    loaded), but JSONY lets you omit a lot of the syntax that makes JSON a
    pain to write.

API
    JSONY has one object method: "load". You pass it a JSONY string and it
    returns the loaded Perl data object.

JSONY SYNTAX
    Here is some examples of JSONY followed by equivalent JSON:

    Words don't need quotes. A list of things is an array:

        foo bar baz

        [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]

    Strings with spaces can use single or double quotes:

        'foo bar'      # <= This is (a comment indicating) a string
        # More commenting
        "baz  boom "

        [ "foo bar ", "baz  boom " ]

    Top level hashes can be ':' separated pairs or use curlies. Sub hashes
    require curlies.

        foo: { bar baz }
        num: -1.2e3

        { "foo": { "bar": "baz" }, "num": -1.2e3 }

    Top level arrays can use '- ' at the start of lines. Those arrays go the
    end of line. Lines can be continued using a trailing comma. Sub arrays
    require square brackets.

        - array of 4 scalars
        - array with [ sub
          array { of
          things }]
        - array of 7 things on,
          two lines

        [
          [ "array", "of", 4, "scalars" ],
          [ "array", "with", [ "sub", "array" { "of": "things" } ] ],
          [ "array", "of", 7, "things", "on", "two", "lines" ]
        ]

    More soon...

    NOTE: You may want to look at the tests (especially "t/load.t") to see
    the full abilities of JSONY.

STATUS
    BEWARE!!!

    JSONY is mst's idea, and ingy's Pegex based implementation. The language
    is just a baby, and will change a lot, or may go away entirely.

    Development people are currently working on this in "#jsony" in
    irc.freenode.net. Please drop by.

    http://jsony.org coming soon.
